        <section class="blog-content">
            <p>Every fiction writer should be a blogger. There. I said it. Here’s the difference blogging made for me: When I sold my first book to a major publisher, I wasn’t blogging, I didn’t have an email list.
                I believed the narrative that fiction writers don’t need a platform. And, to be honest, I was relieved by that idea. I didn’t want to market. I wanted to write. I bet you’ve heard that before. Like in your own thoughts.
                So, I trusted that there wasn’t anything I needed to do to sell my books, except for write them. Only problem was — that book didn’t sell very well.
                I sold another book, a few years later, and this time I knew that creating my audience was my responsibility. No one else was going to do it for me. So I’d started blogging and building an email list.
                That book went out into the world with about 1000 pre-sales. That’s a big deal. It made a major difference.
            </p>
            <p>Blogging gives you the chance to publish regularly — weekly, at least. Maybe even daily. It also puts you in control of the content, something that might be a pleasant change if you’re used to relying on the subjective taste of various gatekeepers for getting your work out.
                Even the most prolific fiction writer doesn’t publish often enough to really build and engage an audience.
                Especially if they’re writing novels. Even if you’re one of those hyper-productive indie-published authors who’s slamming out a novel once a month, that’s a fraction of the number of times you could connect with your audience via blogging.</p>
            <p>But I have only one question for you: <b>Why do you want to build a following from scratch?</b>There are plenty of voracious, established writing outlets that are overflowing with readers:</p>
            <p>Here’s what we should not be blogging about: our own writing. No one cares about our cover reveals or our writing processes. They don’t even know us. They wouldn’t care about our writing process if we were their favorite writers.
                    I can prove it to you. Ask yourself how many writers you follow because you’re riveted by their processes? Uh huh. Exactly. You follow them because they entertain you or they teach you something. You aren’t doing them a favor.
                    It’s all about you. I’m going to say that one more time, because it’s really important. Your readers aren’t doing you a favor. They’re reading your blog for themselves. And please, please, do not write book reviews. This is a bad idea on so many levels. Repeat after me: Book reviews are for readers.
                    Once you become a writer, they aren’t your business. If you’re reviewing books similar to yours, you won’t be able to really be critical, so they’ll be weird, stilted reviews at the very least.
                    I promise you, building a blog around book reviews if you’re a fiction writer is a bad idea.</p>    <p>Blogging gives your audience the chance to get to know you and connect with you personally, which is how you build a base of fans for your body of work. A blog is one of the best means for building an email list full of those fans.
                Blogging is really a no-brainer for fiction writers. We’re already storytellers. We already enjoy the base activity (writing.) There’s a learning curve for the technical aspect, but once that’s overcome, blogging is easy and fun.</p>
            <h2>It starts with figuring out what you want to say.</h2>
            <p>Here’s what we should not be blogging about: our own writing. No one cares about our cover reveals or our writing processes. They don’t even know us. They wouldn’t care about our writing process if we were their favorite writers.

                I promise you, building a blog around book reviews if you’re a fiction writer is a bad idea.</p>
            <h2>Readers are human beings and human beings are all about themselves.</h2>    
            <p>That’s the truth. If you do two things, you’ll be able to build an audience that will love you and follow you and buy your books: introduce them to you and then make it all about them.
                It doesn’t matter what you blog about. Whatever interests you, whatever is interesting about you, whatever you’re good at, whatever you want to be good at. You’ll find people who care about those things, too. 
                And when you write for those readers, they’ll care about you and it becomes a whole circle of life thing. It’s beautiful.</p>

                <p>For the record, just because you’re a writer doesn’t mean that you have to write about writing, either. You can write about anything.
             You’ll find readers who are interested in the topics you want to write about.And as those readers become fans, they’ll get excited with you when you do talk about your fiction.
             Which you will, sometimes. Just not exclusively, or even most of the time. See <a href="https://medium.com/the-1000-day-mfa/if-youre-a-fiction-writer-you-absolutely-should-be-blogging-6ef9e2bb439">Blogging Tips</a>.</p>
