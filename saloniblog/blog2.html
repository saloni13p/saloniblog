            <h3>How to Start Blogging: A Definitive Guide for Authors</h3>
            <p>If you approach blogging as something “lesser than” your book writing or published writing, you’re more likely to fail at it. While blogging can be less formal, less researched, and more geared for online skim-reading or social sharing, to do it well requires the same kind of practice and skill as crafting a novel.
                You get better at it the more you do it, but I see many authors give up before they’ve put in enough hours to understand the medium.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, to stick with blogging long enough for it to pay off, you have to actually enjoy what it means to blog, and how online writing can be different from print.
                If you treat the practice seriously, all the content that you generate for your blog can have another life, in another format or within another publication. For example, the best of my blog content is condensed into a book, Publishing 101. That required a lot of editing and reformulation (online writing can’t be dumped into print without a lot of work), but it reflects the value and depth of what appears on my blog.</p>
            <p>By creating custom actions mapped to specific finding type and by developing a corresponding Lambda function for that custom action, you can achieve targeted, automated remediation for these findings.
                This allows a customer to specifically decide if he or she wants to invoke a remediation action on a specific finding. A customer can also use these Lambda functions as the target of fully automated remediation actions that do not require any human review.</p>
            <p>There are two types of consistency: frequency and subject matter.</p>
            <p><b>Frequency:</b>To gain any kind of momentum, you should commit to 2-4 posts a week. Some people may be able to get by on one post a week, but it’s a struggle to gain traction without volume. Ideally, starting out, you should shoot for several times per week. The longer you blog, and the more of an audience you build up, the more you can ease back on frequency.</p>
            <p><b>Subject matter:</b>Think about this in terms of your headlines for your blog posts. If you look at a month’s worth of your blog headlines, they should convey a strong message about what you cover on your blog and who it’s for.
                A potential reader should be able to easily tell if they’re going to benefit from or enjoy reading your posts on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, authors have trouble staying focused and disciplined on one topic or subject matter, often because they get bored or they think readers will get bored. But again, it’s hard to gain traction if you’re switching it up all the time and not consistent in what you offer.</p>
            <p>If you’re interested in blogging, but worry about the time commitment, then consider creating a multi-contributor blog, where several authors in the same genre (or targeting similar audiences) band together.
                That helps reduce the burden as well as increase the size of your audience starting out—since more people will be marketing and promoting the blog.</p>
            <i>It takes patience to build a readership unless you’re already well-known</i>
            <p>It may take people months before they even become aware that your blog exists. This isn’t necessarily through any fault of your own; there’s an incredible amount of noise around us, and enormous demands on everybody’s attention. But if you make a continual series of impressions over a long period of time on the same topic, then it starts to click: “Oh, this person is blogging, and they’re regularly covering this topic.”
                Some writers assume, “Oh, everybody knows I’m blogging because I posted about it,” but no. That’s not the case, and that’s why consistency is so important.</p>
                <p>In fact, your author blog might even kill your writing. There are hundreds of authors who started blogs, churned out posts for a year, and let it come to a dead stop. Why? Because they realized it wasn’t worth the effort.
                    I’ll show you the five major reasons an author blog can be bad for your writing (with examples). We’ll cover some other, better audience-building methods to focus on instead.
                   And, since I’m a complete hypocrite and I run my own author blog, I’ll show you the one and only reason you might want to start one anyway. Ready? Let’s save your writing...</p>

            <p>Only about 10% of your readers (or even fewer) will make themselves known to you or engage with you on your blog, so it takes a while before you reach a tipping point, where there’s a concrete indication of growing activity or interest.
