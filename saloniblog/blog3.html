            <p>Static author websites are great, and you’d be crazy not to have one. But starting an author blog is a different (and often tragic) story. In fact, your author blog might even kill your writing. There are hundreds of authors who started blogs, churned out posts for a year,
                and let it come to a dead stop. Static author websites are great, and you’d be crazy not to have one. But starting an author blog is a different (and often tragic) story.</p>
            <p>In fact, your author blog might even kill your writing. There are hundreds of authors who started blogs, churned out posts for a year, and let it come to a dead stop. Why? Because they realized it wasn’t worth the effort.
               I’ll show you the five major reasons an author blog can be bad for your writing (with examples). We’ll cover some other, better audience-building methods to focus on instead.
              And, since I’m a complete hypocrite and I run my own author blog, I’ll show you the one and only reason you might want to start one anyway. Ready? Let’s save your writing...</p>
              <p><b>1. Blogging Will Steal Your Valuable Writing Time</b>There are two ways to run a blog:</p>

              <ol><li>Post erratic, guilt-induced content apologizing for why you haven’t posted in a while. Give up. Come back for one or two weeks. Give up again.</li> <li>Post high-quality content on a very measured schedule.</li>
              #2 is extremely effective for building an audience… <b>But it comes with a heavy price:</b> years of your time, effort, and perpetual focus.</p>
              
              <p><b>Blogging takes a lot out of you.</b> You need to come up with content, publish at least once a week, manage your website, deal with commenters, etc. To get a meaningful audience on a blog, you will need to carve a huge, vital chunk out of your writing time every week.</p>
              
              <p>Your author blog will steal creative productivity from the writing projects you actually care about. Jane Friedman, a full-time writer working in the publishing industry, warns about the investment it takes to blog:</p></ol>
            
              <h2>Are There Exceptions to This?</h2>
            <p>Of course. There are no rules in writing. (Though there are some very overconfident guidelines.) Let’s say you publish weekly microfiction to your blog. Every week, you get a little better at storytelling… while also building your audience. Hopefully.</p>
            <p>But I have only one question for you: <b>Why do you want to build a following from scratch?</b>There are plenty of voracious, established writing outlets that are overflowing with readers:</p>
            <p>Here’s what we should not be blogging about: our own writing. No one cares about our cover reveals or our writing processes. They don’t even know us. They wouldn’t care about our writing process if we were their favorite writers.
                I can prove it to you. Ask yourself how many writers you follow because you’re riveted by their processes? Uh huh. Exactly. You follow them because they entertain you or they teach you something. You aren’t doing them a favor.
                It’s all about you. I’m going to say that one more time, because it’s really important. Your readers aren’t doing you a favor. They’re reading your blog for themselves. And please, please, do not write book reviews. This is a bad idea on so many levels. Repeat after me: Book reviews are for readers.
                Once you become a writer, they aren’t your business. If you’re reviewing books similar to yours, you won’t be able to really be critical, so they’ll be weird, stilted reviews at the very least.
                I promise you, building a blog around book reviews if you’re a fiction writer is a bad idea.</p>
            <h2>Readers are human beings and human beings are all about themselves.</h2>    
            <p>That’s the truth. If you do two things, you’ll be able to build an audience that will love you and follow you and buy your books: introduce them to you and then make it all about them.
                It doesn’t matter what you blog about. Whatever interests you, whatever is interesting about you, whatever you’re good at, whatever you want to be good at. You’ll find people who care about those things, too. 
                And when you write for those readers, they’ll care about you and it becomes a whole circle of life thing. It’s beautiful.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, to stick with blogging long enough for it to pay off, you have to actually enjoy what it means to blog, and how online writing can be different from print.
                    If you treat the practice seriously, all the content that you generate for your blog can have another life, in another format or within another publication. For example, the best of my blog content is condensed into a book, Publishing 101. That required a lot of editing and reformulation (online writing can’t be dumped into print without a lot of work), but it reflects the value and depth of what appears on my blog.</p>
                <p>By creating custom actions mapped to specific finding type and by developing a corresponding Lambda function for that custom action, you can achieve targeted, automated remediation for these findings.
                    This allows a customer to specifically decide if he or she wants to invoke a remediation action on a specific finding. A customer can also use these Lambda functions as the target of fully automated remediation actions that do not require any human review.</p>
                <p>There are two types of consistency: frequency and subject matter.</p>
                <p>Of course. There are no rules in writing. (Though there are some very overconfident guidelines.) Let’s say you publish weekly microfiction to your blog. Every week, you get a little better at storytelling… while also building your audience. Hopefully.</p>
